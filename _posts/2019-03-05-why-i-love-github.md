Github is definitely the most popular filehoster for code projects (in my view) and has contributed much to today's Internet as we know it. Without Github, some projects would never have happened, some developers might never have met, and that shows how important it is to move on and develop services that nobody else today thinks about and can imagine that someday many people will appreciate from it. And that's one of many reasons why I love Github.
